# ANCIENT CRYPTOGRAPHY

This is a single page application. Actually, it is the first webpage i have ever made. Its gonna be part of my law school end-of-graduation-paper slide show. It's about Human Rights and Cryptography. It has some cool functionalities. From page 3 to page 6 it has text inputs that you can write messages on, and it will show its encryption on the output area. This page\'s objective is to show how Caesar\'s, Polybius\', Substitution\'s and Vigen√®re\`s cyphers was done. Also, I tried to make it responsive. It was quite fun making this webpage since i never did anything in JavaScript, or HTML or CSS before.
